I told them, ‘This is the best place in the world to me,’ and they just kind of looked around like, ‘Why this place?’ But that’s just what it is, it’s that place where your dreams began.”</p><p>Lopez also brought her mom, <strong>Guadalupe Rodríguez</strong>, back to the Bronx with her and discovered a family secret. Rodriguez admitted she was devastated when a feisty Lopez announced she was dropping out of school to become a performer, and even used to spy on her when she was doing dance classes to make sure she was okay.</p><p>“Everyone has certain hopes or a way they think things should go,” Lopez says of her mom’s concerns. “It was funny to hear when she said that she came and watched me [dance] without me knowing,” Lopez continued, smiling.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“That was a reveal! I was like, ‘Oh, wow, of course she did!’ Because I would do the same thing, now that I’m a mom! If my 17, 18-year-old Emme decided, ‘I’m moving out of the house and I want to become a dancer,’ of course I would go watch her.”</p><p>Not that the Latino beauty is worrying too much about that happening in the future. “They love dancing and they love music,” she told <strong>Us</strong>, of her two children. “They love to sing. But I don’t know if they’ll be performers. I could see them being artists, but I don’t know if they’ll be performers. They’re still little though. We’ll see!”</p><p><a href=#>Neighborhood Sessions</a> with Jennifer Lopez will premiere Saturday, Feb. 14 during TNT’s exclusive coverage of NBA All-Star Weekend, directly following the network’s coverage of State Farm NBA All-Star Saturday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGepp6es6a%2BjKWmqZ2qYq%2Bztc2gqmaglad6rLXDrGStp12ptaZ5waump7Bdq7a0tdOsZJ%2BhoqjBbrDAp5qeZaOpwqW1zmZpaWllZn5z</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cole-sprouse-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cole Sprouse (Actor) Wiki, Bio, Age Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career, Family, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dave-attell-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Dave Attell Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rod-wave-net-worth.html>Rod Wave Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./superior-view-of-axis-game.html>Superior view of Axis Quiz</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ellie-kemper-net-worth.html>What is Ellie Kemper Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Her Wealth and Financial</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./inna-congratulates-couple-engagement-flight.html>Inna congratulates couple on their engagement during flight</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gen-z-daughter-and-boyfriend-door-closed.html>Mom Catches Gen Z Daughter With Boyfriend Behind Closed Doors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
