Her Christmas messages and Christian-style wedding may be interpreted as a sign.</p><h2><span id=Madisyn_and_Coreys_Relationship_Timeline>Madisyn and Corey’s Relationship Timeline</span></h2><p>Madisyn and Corey met while attending Northwest Cabarrus High School in Kannapolis, North Carolina. They met through Madisyn’s older sister, who happens to be in the same grade as Corey. In 2012, they attended Corey’s senior prom together. Furthermore, Madisyn’s first Instagram photo shows them at the event. After Corey graduated, the couple tried long-distance dating. However, they suffered because they were so young at the time.</p><p>Three years later, in 2015, she rekindled their relationship by visiting him while he was playing in the minor leagues. Madisyn told Inside Weddings,</p><p><strong>“I saw he still had a picture frame I gave him of us, and it just melted me.”</strong></p><p>Corey proposed to his high school sweetheart on December 7, 2019, after securing her parents’ consent while in Boston to see an NFL New England Patriots game. The couple chose Nashville, Tennessee, as their wedding venue since it was a city they adored.</p><p>Unfortunately, the entire world was shut down due to the outbreak in 2020, therefore the couple decided to continue their plans with only their closest friends and family present. After roughly 8 years of dating, Corey and Madisyn married on December 5, 2020, at Saddle Wood Farms.</p><h2><span id=More_about_Madisyn_Van_Ham>More about Madisyn Van Ham</span></h2><p>Madisyn graduated from East Carolina University with a bachelor’s degree in business administration and a personal selling marketing certification, according to her LinkedIn profile.
