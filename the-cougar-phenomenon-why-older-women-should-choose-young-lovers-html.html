But once a woman hits 40, that’s no longer true.</p><p>“And the funny thing is that it actually gives a biological argument for the cougar phenomenon of an older woman selecting to be with a younger male.</p><p>“What we found astounding is that the average age of the men in the group that is not getting pregnant is relatively young. It’s not the ages that we thought.”</p><p>It is the first study to look at the impact of male age for older women and could explain why increasing numbers of women, such as director Sam Taylor-Wood, 47, are choosing younger partners. Her actor husband Aaron Johnson is just 24, and they have two children.</p><p>The researchers studied women between 40 and 46 who undertook 904 IVF cycles between 2010 and 2012. In couples where the male was 43 and a half or older, no children were born. But older women with younger partners went on to have babies.</p><p>Previous studies have shown the children of men over 55 are at greater risk of autism, bipolar disorder, low IQ and schizophrenia and are likely to be less attractive.</p><p>But the new research suggests that even in their early forties, men are already beginning to lose their fertility.</p><p>“It’s starting to occur at a very young age,” said Dr Dahan.</p><p>“If you have a 37 or 36 year old woman, probably the male age is not such a factor. But once you get to 40 and the changes that go along with reproduction in a 40-year-old woman, that’s where the male age became the factor.</p><p>“The reality is that most men are probably with women of a similar age, so as the woman is getting older, the male is also getting older.</p><p>“It suggests that once the woman is reaching 40 and the man is in his early 40s as well, that the male is having a biological clock that is contributing to their ability to have a live birth. “</p><p>Over the past 40 years the average age of childbearing in England has been increasing steadily for both men and women.</p><p>According to the Office for National Statistics the average woman gives birth just a week short of her 30th birthday while first-time mothers are also older, at just over 28. The average age of fathers is now 32 years and six months.</p><p>Women are born with all their eggs, but male sperm is constantly replicating. Each time sperm replicates there is a chance for a mutation in the DNA to occur. As men age, they are also exposed to numerous environmental toxins which have been shown to cause DNA mutations in sperm.</p><p>Molecular genetic studies have shown that the sperm of older men have far more mutations than those of younger men.</p><p>Professor Dagan Wells, a leading fertility expert at Oxford University said that older women may find it easier to get pregnant with a younger man.</p><p>"We know that the DNA in the sperm of older men suffers a loss of integrity. The DNA should be a nice long uninterrupted molecule but in older men it breaks up into little bits.</p><p>"The egg is rich in enzymes which repairs DNA damage but it could be that (as women age) that the egg is getting more challenged. There might be a tipping point."</p><p>It means that men who become fathers in their 50s or 60s are not more virile, they are just likely to have a younger partner whose egg has repaired their mutated sperm.</p><p>Professor Charles Kingsland, consultant gynecologist at Liverpool Womens NHS Foundation Trust, added: “There are biological reasons why an older woman would benefit from a younger man.</p><p>“Not only are male sperm likely to be healthier but woman live a lot longer."</p><p>The research was presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine annual meeting in Hawaii.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwv8KinKeblWR%2Bcn2XamhscF%2BJtaZ5oqisoJmiYr2psc2opJ6mn6N6uLTYZqalnJWneri7zJ6lZquYpMKtsIycn6ino5p6urvUp55mpJ%2BrsrO%2FjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-clarkson-style-divides-fans.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Clarkson sparks a debate among fans as they weigh in on her latest fashion choice</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-hendricks-photoshoot-for-the-edit-unflattering-or-vintage-fab.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christina Hendricks photoshoot for The Edit: unflattering or vintage-fab?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rod-wave-net-worth.html>Rod Wave Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./superior-view-of-axis-game.html>Superior view of Axis Quiz</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ellie-kemper-net-worth.html>What is Ellie Kemper Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Her Wealth and Financial</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./inna-congratulates-couple-engagement-flight.html>Inna congratulates couple on their engagement during flight</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gen-z-daughter-and-boyfriend-door-closed.html>Mom Catches Gen Z Daughter With Boyfriend Behind Closed Doors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
