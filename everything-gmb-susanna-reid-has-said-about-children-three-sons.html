"<strong>Every time I've called he’s answered immediately and he's wanted to talk</strong>," she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>You</a> magazine in 2021. "And I'm filled with love every time, because I think: 'OK, he's gone, but he's not gone gone. He still wants to feel that connection.'"</p><p id=eY4jcMskyQXv data-wc=89>Susanna opened up about feeling "guilt" over not being "present" enough when her kids were younger. "There are moments when you think: '<strong>Why was I not present when they were tiny?</strong>' I was around a lot for them, but sometimes you can regret you weren't there playing with them every single moment of every single day," she admitted. "You have that kind of guilt. Yet now I'm able to have a more grown-up, funny, chatty relationship with them, where they're hugely independent but they still need you. That's lovely."</p><p id=enj8P2JQ710Y data-wc=22>In March last year, Susanna announced that she had <a class=hm-link href=#>taken a step back from "extra work"</a> to spend more time with her children in their final years of education.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLRzqB3uCztV data-wc=31>"I've made the decision this year, because my boys are doing GCSE and A levels, <strong>it is really important for me that I am present</strong>,' she told magazine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8c5ea7bfc5fb-susanna-reid-richard-madeley-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e84mE04ua-ei data-wc=8><strong>Susanna hosts Good Morning Britain alongside Richard Madeley</strong></p><p id=eZhnCbCIniii data-wc=43>"So I've got Good Morning Britain, which is my full-time job, and then I'm there for the boys. I've got one more documentary coming out, which has already been filmed, but<strong> I actually made a decision not to do extra work</strong>," she said.</p><p id=ePI2n7cyOfZF data-wc=56>The journalist also added that her work schedule allows her to be with her sons when they finish school in the afternoon. "I work so early in the morning, I come off air at nine o'clock, have a nap, then I'm up for my boys at the end of school. That's an enormous privilege," she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=e42uIGwEhbqw data-wc=48>While her three boys are undoubtedly aware of their mum's fame, they <a class=hm-link href=#>don't tune into GMB each morning</a> to see her on-screen. "<strong>They don't watch me</strong>," she explained. "Sometimes clips of the programme are on TikTok and there’s a little bit of a: 'Wow, OK, Mum's on TikTok,' but it’s not a big deal."</p><p id=eAeJ9SM6HtJe data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
