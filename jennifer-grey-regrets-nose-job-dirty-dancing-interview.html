The 62-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actress</a> admitted to regretting getting two nose jobs after starring in her breakthrough role as Baby <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>opposite<strong> Patrick Swayze</strong></a> in the 1987 film Dirty Dancing&nbsp;and explained that it left her looking “unrecognizable” to some, including <strong>Michael Douglas</strong>. She recalled attending a premiere shortly after her second rhinoplasty and said the actor didn’t know who she was when he turned around.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“That was the first time I had gone out in public. And it became the thing, the idea of being completely invisible, from one day to the next,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “In the world’s eyes, I was no longer me. and the weird thing was that thing that I resisted my whole life, and the thing I was so upset with my mother for always telling me I should do my nose. I really thought it was capitulating. I really thought it meant surrendering to the enemy camp. I just thought, ‘I’m good enough. I shouldn’t have to do this.’ That’s really what I felt. ‘I’m beautiful enough.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jennifer-Grey-Regrets-Nose-Job-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jennifer further explained that her mother, <strong>Jo Wilder</strong>, who was also an actress, was the first person to suggest she get a nose job to make it in the acting industry. “She loves me, loved me, always has, and she was pragmatic because she was saying, ‘Guess what? It’s too hard to cast you. Make it easier for them.’ And then I did and she was right,” she said. “It wasn’t like, ‘You’re not pretty.’ It’s like, ‘Guess what? If you don’t want to be an actor, okay. But if you wanna be an actor…'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“But when I was a kid, I was completely anti-rhinoplasty,” she continued. “I mean it was like my religion. I loved that my parents did it. [Underwent rhinoplasty] I understand it was the 50s. I understand they were assimilating. I understood that you had to change your name and you had to do certain things, and it was just normalized, right? You can’t be gay. You can’t be Jewish. You know, you can’t look Jewish. You’re just trying to fit into whatever is the group think.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jennifer-Grey-Regrets-Nose-Job-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In her memoir, Jennifer also touches upon her nose jobs and how they made her feel. “Overnight I lose my identity and my career,” she reportedly wrote. “I spent so much energy trying to figure out what I did wrong, why I was banished from the kingdom. That’s a lie. I banished myself.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In addition to writing about plastic surgery, Jennifer writes about other memorable moments throughout <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her career</a> and personal life, including dating actors <strong>Matthew Broderick</strong> and <strong>Johnny Depp</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Out of the Corner comes out on May 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5BxZqOdnqO2p7HRZp6rnaliv6az0Z6rrGWepMCmecmomWacmafBunnDmqWcoZ6ceqq6056pr6GVrHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./future-sends-mothers-day-wishes-to-6-women-he-has-kids-with.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Future Sends Mothers Day Wishes to 6 Women He Has Kids With</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./actors-who-said-no-to-starring-in-game-of-thrones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Actors Who Said No To Starring In Game Of Thrones</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rod-wave-net-worth.html>Rod Wave Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./superior-view-of-axis-game.html>Superior view of Axis Quiz</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ellie-kemper-net-worth.html>What is Ellie Kemper Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Her Wealth and Financial</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./inna-congratulates-couple-engagement-flight.html>Inna congratulates couple on their engagement during flight</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gen-z-daughter-and-boyfriend-door-closed.html>Mom Catches Gen Z Daughter With Boyfriend Behind Closed Doors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
