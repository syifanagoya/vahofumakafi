Foremost among these is his longstanding stint as the host of <strong>‘The Tonight Show’</strong>, where he not only captivated audiences but also amassed a considerable portion of his wealth.</p><p>His salary from the show, over the years, contributed significantly to his worth.</p><p>Moreover, Leno’s <strong>stand-up comedy tours</strong> have been more than just a platform for his humor—they’ve been a substantial income source.</p><p>Unlike many celebrities who splurge, Leno is known for his frugality, having famously not spent a dime of his talk show earnings, living instead on his stand-up revenue.</p><h3><span id=Car-Collection-as-a-Contributor-to-His-Wealth>Car Collection as a Contributor to His Wealth</span></h3><p>Jay Leno’s passion for cars is more than just a hobby; it’s an investment.
