Only a select few have the means to make such a purchase, and because of the limited number of pro sports teams out there, even fewer, have the opportunity to make such a purchase. As a result, some end up paying exorbitant amounts for the opportunity to own a team, such as <a href=#>Steve Ballmer</a>,&nbsp;paying $2 billion to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers in 2014. While most people who buy sports teams aren't in it solely for the moneymaking aspect, there is something to be said about being able to enjoy watching your team play, while making money at the same time. And that's exactly what one ownership group has been able to do over the past three years.</p><p>In 2013, an ownership group led by Indian businessman <strong><a href=#>Vivek Ranadive</a></strong> purchased the NBA's Sacramento Kings for a then-record <strong>$534 million</strong>. Many onlookers thought the franchise's purchase price was too hefty, especially for a team that has been in decline since its glory years of the early 2000s, failing to make the playoffs for nearly a decade. Paying over half a billion dollars&nbsp;for one of the worst franchises in the league seemed ridiculous to many. But then something amazing happened.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-184908 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Vivek-Ranadive.jpg alt="Vivek Ranadive with Coach George Karl (Via Getty Images)" width=900 height=607 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-184908 class=wp-caption-text>Vivek Ranadive with Coach George Karl (Via Getty Images)</p><p>The aforementioned purchase of the Los Angeles Clippers by Steve Ballmer in 2014 completely changed the NBA landscape. Ballmer payed roughly TRIPLE the amount that many analysts determined the team was actually worth. In turn, the value of NBA franchises has skyrocketed, and the owners of the Kings have reaped huge benefits. Less than three years after making their then-record purchase of the Kings, the value of the team has soared to <strong>$925 million</strong>, a whopping 73 percent increase in value since 2013.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-184906 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kings.jpg alt="Getty Images" width=900 height=607 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-184906 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><p>According to analysts, the team's naming rights deal with Golden 1 Credit Union for its new arena, which will open later this year, is worth $6 million annually. In addition, attendance and ticket sales at their current arena, Sleep Train Arena, have risen over the course of the past two seasons, which is a major part of the team's estimated revenue of $121 million. The NBA's new $2.6 billion TV deal, which will come into effect at the start of next season, has also bolstered the value of all NBA franchises.</p><p>While the owners of the Sacramento Kings are likely very happy with their investment, they're a long way from touching the most valuable team in basketball; the New York Knicks. The Knickerbockers are worth a hefty $3 BILLION.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmWfrLumvtJmpp9lpJ2ybr%2FAnKmapZWjwbB5yqKloKtdlr%2BmedWeqbJlmJa9scWMsKCtoF2ptaa10Wagp66VqMGusc2tZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kathleen-biden.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lawyer, Kathleen Biden- Meet Ex-Wife Of Hunter Biden (m. 19932017)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./about-samantha-fox.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Samantha Fox Coming Out &amp;amp; Facing New Challenges &amp;amp; Harassment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rod-wave-net-worth.html>Rod Wave Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./superior-view-of-axis-game.html>Superior view of Axis Quiz</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ellie-kemper-net-worth.html>What is Ellie Kemper Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Her Wealth and Financial</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./inna-congratulates-couple-engagement-flight.html>Inna congratulates couple on their engagement during flight</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gen-z-daughter-and-boyfriend-door-closed.html>Mom Catches Gen Z Daughter With Boyfriend Behind Closed Doors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
