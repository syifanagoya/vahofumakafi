He is expected to return to a Manhattan courtroom in May.&nbsp;</p><p>Chaudhry has indicated that her team is quickly gathering and presenting evidence to the District Attorney, with the expectation that all charges will be dropped imminently.&nbsp;</p><p>The District Attorney has already granted a limited court-ordered protection for the alleged victim, and a full order of protection has been requested.</p><p>Majors’ spokesperson has denied any wrongdoing, saying that the actor “has done nothing wrong” and that they look forward to clearing his name.&nbsp;</p><p>Majors is set to star in an upcoming spin-off called “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” and his character is expected to appear in other movies leading up to the 2026 Secret Wars film.&nbsp;</p><p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been gearing up to make Kang the next major villain the Avengers will have to face.</p><p>Majors’ arrest raises questions about his continuing participation in the Marvel franchise, given that parent company Disney is known for being family-friendly.&nbsp;</p><p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been highly successful, raking in nearly $30 billion over the past decade and a half.</p><p>It is important to note that domestic violence is a serious issue that affects millions of people around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>It is essential that allegations of domestic violence are taken seriously and investigated thoroughly. It is also important to remember that everyone is innocent until proven guilty and that it is possible for false allegations to be made.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome of this case, it is important to continue to raise awareness about domestic violence and to provide support and resources for survivors.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2zqeYraCRo3qurcmoqaxll56%2FrbLRopynnF2nsqStza2qaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./afrojack-reveals-his-hidden-talent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Afrojack Reveals His Hidden Talent</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-mixon-obituary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Deeply mourned Jerry Mixon Obituary: In Loving Memory of Jerry Mixon, a beloved resident of Summ</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rod-wave-net-worth.html>Rod Wave Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./superior-view-of-axis-game.html>Superior view of Axis Quiz</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ellie-kemper-net-worth.html>What is Ellie Kemper Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Her Wealth and Financial</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./inna-congratulates-couple-engagement-flight.html>Inna congratulates couple on their engagement during flight</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gen-z-daughter-and-boyfriend-door-closed.html>Mom Catches Gen Z Daughter With Boyfriend Behind Closed Doors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
