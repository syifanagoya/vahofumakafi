The “Uptown Funk” chose to go as Wednesday’s brother, Pugsley, who is known for wearing striped shirts similar to the one Mars had on.</p><p class=dh>The photo featured other people- probably friends of Caban and Mars- who portrayed other members of the Addams family.</p><p class=dh>Alongside the photo uploaded yesterday, Caban wrote:</p><p class=dh>“HALLOWEEN is approaching... how will we ever top this”</p><p><h3 class=ih>PRIVATE COUPLE</h3></p><p class=dh>The post is only one of the few on Caban’s page that features her famous longtime boyfriend. Despite being together for seven years, Mars and his model girlfriend keep their relationship very private. Apart from a few Grammy Award red carpets, the two are almost never pictured together.</p><p><h3 class=ih>MEXICO GETAWAY</h3></p><p class=dh>About two months ago, Mars, 33, was <a class="me a" href=#>spotted</a> with his lady love as they spent a luxurious vacation in Punta Mita, Mexico. The “Finesse” singer was taking a break from his ongoing world tour when paparazzi took photos of him with a fuller figure and a protruding belly.</p><p class=dh>Mars didn’t seem to be hiding his figure anyway since he was shirtless and donned only patterned beach shorts. At one point, he kept his curls under a large sun hat before showing them off braided.</p><p class=dh>Caban was with him on that trip and showed off her toned midriff and long legs in a black and yellow leopard-print swimwear.</p><p class=dh>Earlier this year, Caban, who also has a swimwear line, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.msn.com/en-au/entertainment/celebrity/who-is-bruno-marss-girlfriend-get-to-know-his-long-time-love-jessica-caban/ar-BBIuspu>accompanied</a> her man to the Grammy Awards where he took home the prize in all his nominated categories.</p><p class=dh>Besides representing Jennifer Lopez's clothing line, “J-LO,” Caban is also an actress and reality star who won the first ever “Model Latina” in 2008.</p><p><h3 class=ih>NO MARRIAGE PLANS</h3></p><p class=dh>The beauty <a class="me a" href=#>reportedly</a> met Mars when she was living in New York and moved into his LA home after only one year of dating. Mars’ heart-wrenching ballad “When I Was Your Man” is also said to be about Caban.</p><p class=dh>Despite their love story, Mars and Caban are not likely to be walking down the aisle anytime soon. The “Grenade” singer replied after he was asked about marriage:</p><p class=dh>“Jesus! She’s my best friend. My rock. What’s wrong with that? We’re just happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpobm1hbXqjvtSnpmalkafAbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V5w6ucrKtdmLWquMOrnKdlpJ2yb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aaron-chen-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Aaron Chen Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leila-arcieri-age-height-career-net-worth-boyfriend-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leila Arcieri: Early Life, Career, Net Worth &amp;amp; Boyfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rod-wave-net-worth.html>Rod Wave Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./superior-view-of-axis-game.html>Superior view of Axis Quiz</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ellie-kemper-net-worth.html>What is Ellie Kemper Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Her Wealth and Financial</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./inna-congratulates-couple-engagement-flight.html>Inna congratulates couple on their engagement during flight</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gen-z-daughter-and-boyfriend-door-closed.html>Mom Catches Gen Z Daughter With Boyfriend Behind Closed Doors</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVib.
