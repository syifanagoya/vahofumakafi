Jake Paul is consistently one of the highest-paid social media stars in the world, making a minimum of $20 million and as much as $50 million every year (before taxes) through a mix of boxing events, merchandise, YouTube video views and endorsements.</p><p>Jake earned $45 million in 2021 thanks primarily to his three professional boxing matches, with $5 million coming from endorsements and social media earnings. Between September 2022 and September 2023 he earned $34 million.</p><p>He first gained extensive media coverage when the music video for his 2017 single "It's Everyday Bro" went viral on YouTube. He is the younger brother of YouTube star <a href=#>Logan Paul</a>. In recent years Jake has embarked on a career as a boxer. He has defeated a number of opponents in matches that have been ordered by millions of Pay Per View watchers.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jake Joseph Paul was born on January 17, 1997, in Westlake, Ohio to Pamela Stepnick and Gregory Paul. He has one brother, Logan, who is also a popular YouTube star. Jake got started posting videos on the now-defunct video platform Vine. He had nearly five and a half million followers and two billion views on Vine when it shut down.</p><p>Jake launched his video career in September 2013. Once Vine closed down in January 2017, Disney hired Jake to be on the sitcom "Bizaardvark."&nbsp;His catchphrase on the show was "It's Everyday Bro!" (Side note: That catchphrase is not grammatically correct. "Everyday" means commonplace, ordinary or routine, for example: "these are my everyday run-of-the-mill socks." I'm pretty sure Jake is intending to say "It's Every Day, Bro!" which would mean something that happens each dayâ€¦)</p><p>In July 2017, Jake was fired from "Bizaardvark" during the filming of the second season. By that time, Paul had generated a bunch of controversies including complaints from his neighbors about wild parties, pranks, fire hazards, and the enormous crowds of young fans that gathered in the street outside of Paul's rented house after he published his address on social media. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Paul confirmed that he was fired from the Disney Channel show due to the hubbub over his parties and the local news coverage of it.</p><p>Jake Paul launched Team 10 in January 2017. Team 10 is a digital influencer marketing platform and creative agency that creates and promotes entertainment for teenagers. In May of that same year, he released a song and music video called "It's Everyday Bro." The video got more than 70 million views in one month.</p><p>In early January 2018, Paul uploaded a video called "I lost my virginity." The video's thumbnail showed Paul and his then-girlfriend Erika Costell laying semi-nude on top of each other. YouTube age-restricted the video as a result. Paul changed the thumbnail to a clothed photo of the couple.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295114 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jake-Paul.jpg alt="Jake Paul Net Worth" width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1256px) 100vw, 1256px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295114 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Jerod Harris/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=boxing-career-earnings><strong>Boxing Career and Earnings</strong></h2><p>From his 2021 boxing matches alone, Jake earned $40 million between purses and Pay Per View bonuses.</p><p>Jake Paul made his professional boxing debut on January 20, 2020, in Miami.

He was expected to earn around <span><strong>$9 million</strong></span> from the match, but the Problem Child took to social media and claimed that he made $30 million for the bout.</p><p>In 2023, Jake Paul signed a multiyear contract with the Professional Fighters League (PFL) to compete in a new pay-per-view division.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>On July 18, 2017, Paul's neighbors in Los Angeles met with city council members and law enforcement officials with the intention of filing a public nuisance lawsuit against the YouTube star. Paul made the address of his rented home in the Beverly Grove neighborhood public and large crowds of fans gathered outside the house. Paul was eventually sued for $2.5 million by his landlords.</p><p>Paul started dating model Erika Costello in 2018. They broke up in November 2018.

In April 2023, Paul started dating Dutch speed skater Jutta Leerdam.</p><p>In 2019, Paul threw a massive party at his Calabasas, California mansion. Authorities investigated whether or not a number of young, female guests had their drinks spiked. At least one person filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department alleging that their drink had been drugged. In a Facebook post on the "Moms of Conejo Valley" page, a concerned mom wrote: "My daughter was at a party in Calabasas last night for YouTube Jake Paul. The house was a mansion filled with young people. She ended up in the hospital with eight other girls who had been drugged and ended up at West Hills Hospital incoherent." The mom said the girls were half-naked and couldn't talk or walk.</p><p>On May 30, 2020, during the George Floyd/Black Lives Matter protests in Scottsdale, Arizona, Paul was having dinner at P.F. Changs in the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall. People began looting the mall. Paul and his friends waded into the middle of the looting to video what was happening. He was&nbsp;charged with criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly, both of which are misdemeanor charges. He was not arrested. He will have to appear in court in Arizona.</p><p>During the summer of 2020, Jake Paul faced a lot of criticism for the big house parties he threw during the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. No face masks or social distancing was required at Paul's parties. Furthermore, despite local regulations, Paul has no plans to stop throwing his illegal gatherings because he wants to "live his life." A party on July 14, 2020 was condemned by Calabassas mayor Alicia Weintraub.</p><h2 id=salary-highlights><strong>Salary Highlights</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Jake earned an estimated $11.5 million.

The oversized shower in the bathroom features steam, aromatherapy, and Bluetooth capabilities.&nbsp;A pool and spa with two waterfalls sit on the densely landscaped grounds, which includes two grills and multiple patios overlooking the canyon.</p><p>Jake announced his intention to list the home for sale in January 2021 for around $7 million.
